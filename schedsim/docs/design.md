# CPU Scheduling Simulator Design Plan
CMSC 125 – Operating Systems  
Laboratory Activity: CPU Scheduling Simulator

This document outlines the design strategy, implementation roadmap, and development phases for the CPU scheduling simulator. The goal of this project is to build a modular simulator written in C that implements several CPU scheduling algorithms and allows comparative analysis of their performance.

---

# 1. Project Overview

The simulator will execute workloads consisting of processes with arrival times and CPU burst times. The system will simulate CPU scheduling policies and compute performance metrics such as turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

The simulator will support the following scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come First-Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Time to Completion First (STCF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

The simulator will also generate ASCII Gantt charts to visualize execution timelines and provide comparison outputs across algorithms.

At the current stage of development, the simulator already supports the First-Come First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) . The system can successfully load workload files, execute these algorithms, and compute performance metrics for each process. The remaining algorithms will be implemented in the next development phases.

---

# 2. Project Architecture

The system is designed using modular components to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

## 2.1 Core Components

The simulator is divided into the following modules:

### Process Management
Responsible for representing processes and loading workloads from input files.

Responsibilities:
- Process data structure
- Workload file parsing
- Process initialization
- Tracking runtime state

### Scheduling Engine
Controls the simulation of time and determines which process runs at each time unit.

Responsibilities:
- Simulation loop
- Process arrival handling
- Ready queue management
- Algorithm selection

### Scheduling Algorithms
Each scheduling algorithm is implemented as a separate module.

Algorithms:
- FCFS (non-preemptive)
- SJF (non-preemptive)
- STCF (preemptive)
- RR (preemptive)
- MLFQ (adaptive priority scheduler)

#### Currently implemented algorithms:
- FCFS (First-Come First-Serve) – non-preemptive
- SJF (Shortest Job First) – non-preemptive

#### Planned algorithms not yet Implemented:
- STCF (Shortest Time to Completion First) – preemptive
- RR (Round Robin) – preemptive with configurable time quantum
- MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue) – adaptive priority scheduler

### Metrics Module
Calculates performance statistics for each process and averages across workloads.

Metrics:
- Finish Time
- Turnaround Time
- Waiting Time
- Response Time

### Visualization Module
Responsible for generating ASCII Gantt charts showing process execution timelines.

### CLI Interface
Handles command-line arguments and allows users to select scheduling algorithms and configuration parameters.

# 4. Current Implementation Status

At the current stage of development, several core components of the CPU scheduling simulator have already been implemented.

Completed features include:
